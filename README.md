# CPSC-599-Final-Proj
## Final project for CPSC 599 F24 | Goob: Mechanic Mayday

## For WIP Demo Submission:
A few notes...
- All of the code that actually is used to compile the game is in src, any other folders contain complimentary programs/data/etc.
- Regarding the python scripts, the level_editor was not used right now for level data. It is still being worked on to output level data for the game. The script make_level_data.py was used instead.
- The other scripts were used in some capacity
